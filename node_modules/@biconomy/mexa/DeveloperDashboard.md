# Biconomy Dashboard

## Introduction

Biconomy Dashboard allows developers to register their DApps \(Decentralized Applications\), smart contracts and select methods/api on which a developer wants to enable meta transactions or gasless transactions. To enable gasless transactions in your dapp head over to our docs at [https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions](https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions).
